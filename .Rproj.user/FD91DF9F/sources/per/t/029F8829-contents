## A few consideration about this doc
This Quarto document serves as a practical illustration of the concepts covered in the productive workflow online course. It’s designed primarily for _educational purposes_, so the focus is on demonstrating Quarto techniques rather than on the rigor of its scientific content.
The callout reference page is [here](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/callouts.html).

## Introduction
This is the case study to make an html report by quarto. 
You can read more about the **penguin dataset** [here](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/).

Let's **load** libraries before we start!

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# load the tidyverse
library(tidyverse)
library(hrbrthemes)    # ipsum theme for ggplot2 charts
library(patchwork)     # combine charts together
library(DT)            # interactive tables
library(knitr)         # static table with the kable() function

```
## Loading data

The dataset has already been loaded and cleaned in the previous step of this pipeline.

Let's load the clean version, together with a few functions available in `functions.R`!

```{r}
# Source functions
source(file = "functions.R")

# Read the clean dataset
data <- readRDS(file = "../input/clean_data.rds")
```

![Bill measurement explanation](asset/culmen_depth.png){fig-align="center"  width=300}

In case you’re wondering how the original dataset looks like, here is a searchable version of it, made using the DT package
```{r}
datatable(data = data, options = list(pageLength =5), filter = "top")
```


## Bill Length and Bill Depth

Now, let's make some descriptive analysis, including __summary statistics__ and __graphs__.

What's striking is the __slightly negative relationship__ between `bill length` and `bill depth`:


```{r, fig.align = "center", fig.width=5, fig.height=5, warning=FALSE, fig.cap="Relationship between bill <b>length</b> and bill <b>depth</b>. <b>All</b> data points included."}
data %>%
  ggplot(
    aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = bill_depth_mm)
  ) +
    geom_point(color="#69b3a2") +
    labs(
      x = "Bill Length (mm)",
      y = "Bill Depth (mm)",
      title = paste("Surprising relationship?")
    ) + 
  theme_classic()


```

It is also interesting to note that `bill length` a and `bill depth` are quite different from one specie to another. The average of a variable can be computed as follow:

$$Avg  = \frac{1}{n} \displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i = \frac{a_1+a_2+\dots+a_n}{n}$$

`bill length` and `bill depth` averages are summarized in the 2 tables below.


```{r}
#| layout-ncol: 2

# Calculating mean bill length for different species and islands using dplyr
bill_length_per_specie <-
data %>%
  # filter(species == "Adelie") %>%
  group_by(species) %>%
  summarize(mean_bill_length = round(mean(as.numeric(bill_length_mm), na.rm = TRUE), 2))

# Calculating average bill depth for different species and islands using dplyr
bill_depth_per_specie <-
data %>%
  # filter(species == "Adelie") %>%
  group_by(species) %>%
  summarize(mean_bill_depth = round(mean(as.numeric(bill_depth_mm), na.rm = TRUE), 2))
adelie_avg <- 
  data%>%
  filter(species == "Adelie") %>% 
  # group_by(species) %>%
  summarize(mean_bill_length = round(mean(as.numeric(bill_length_mm), na.rm = TRUE), 2))

# Display in the Quarto report
kable(bill_length_per_specie)
kable(bill_depth_per_specie)
```


For instance, the average bill length for the specie `Adelie` is `r adelie_avg` 



Now, let's check the relationship between bill depth and bill length for the specie `Adelie` on the island `Torgersen`:


```{r, warning=FALSE, fig.height=3, fig.width=9, fig.cap="There is actually a positive correlation when split by species."}

#
# Use the function in functions.R
p1 <- create_scatterplot(data, "Adelie", "#6689c6")
p2 <- create_scatterplot(data, "Chinstrap", "#e85252")
p3 <- create_scatterplot(data, "Gentoo", "#9a6fb0")

p1+p2+p3

```





## `plotly` and `ggplotly`
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(gapminder)

p <- gapminder %>%
  filter(year==1977) %>%
  ggplot( aes(gdpPercap, lifeExp, size = pop, color=continent)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_bw()
library(plotly)
ggplotly(p)
```
