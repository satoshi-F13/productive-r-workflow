"
"1","
"
"1","Welcome to renv! It looks like this is your first time using renv.
"
"1","This is a one-time message, briefly describing some of renv's functionality.
"
"1","
"
"1","renv will write to files within the active project folder, including:
"
"1","
"
"1","  - A folder 'renv' in the project directory, and
"
"1","  - A lockfile called 'renv.lock' in the project directory.
"
"1","
"
"1","In particular, projects using renv will normally use a private, per-project
"
"1","R library, in which new packages will be installed. This project library is
"
"1","isolated from other R libraries on your system.
"
"1","
"
"1","In addition, renv will update files within your project directory, including:
"
"1","
"
"1","  - .gitignore
"
"1","  - .Rbuildignore
"
"1","  - .Rprofile
"
"1","
"
"1","Finally, renv maintains a local cache of data on the filesystem, located at:
"
"1","
"
"1","  - ""~/AppData/Local/R/cache/R/renv""
"
"1","
"
"1","This path can be customized: please see the documentation in `]8;;ide:help:renv::paths?renv::paths]8;;`.
"
"1","
"
"1","Please read the introduction vignette with `vignette(""renv"")` for more information.
"
"1","You can browse the package documentation online at https://rstudio.github.io/renv/.
